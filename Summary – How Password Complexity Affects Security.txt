Summary â€“ How Password Complexity Affects Security

* Increased password length and complexity make it much harder for attackers to guess or crack.
* Using a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols greatly increases the number of possible combinations.
* Random and unpredictable passwords are far more secure than those with patterns or dictionary words.
* Long, unique, random passwords can take years or even centuries to crack with current technology.
* Complexity combined with uniqueness protects against brute-force, dictionary, and credential stuffing attacks.
