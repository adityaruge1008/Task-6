Creating Strong Passwords:

1) Length: Minimum 12â€“16 characters.

2)Complexity: Use a combination of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

3)Avoid common words & patterns: No names, birthdays, or dictionary words.

4)Randomness: Use password managers to generate truly random passwords.

5)Unique per account: Never reuse passwords across different services.

6)Passphrases: Consider using 4+ random words combined with numbers/symbols (e.g., Blue$Tiger9!Sky).
